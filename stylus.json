  // Place your snippets for Stylus here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "tenderoom import shared files": {
    "prefix": "imp-tenderoom",
    "body": [
      "@require '~shared/view/styles/variables'",
      "@require '~shared/view/styles/mixins'",
      "@require '~shared/view/styles/palette'",
      "$0"
    ],
    "description": "tenderoom import shared files"
  },
  "tenderoom set font families": {
    "prefix": "set-font-tenderoom",
    "body": [
      "set-font-families($$secondary-font, $$hebrew-font)$0"
    ],
    "description": "tenderoom set font families"
